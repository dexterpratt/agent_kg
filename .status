## Current State

- most tests passing but some outstanding. Resolve these first.  Also review the new logging outputs from the tests to see that they are consistent

- Critical issue investigation in progress:
  * Database clearing on errors being monitored
  * Transaction boundaries now clearly logged
  * Connection state changes tracked
  * Test database state tracked before/after operations

- the new database operations need to be exposed as tools
- we need tools for the agent to list and describe tables

Implementation Status:
- Enhanced logging implemented to track database operations:
  * Added detailed transaction logging in server.py
  * Added database state tracking in tests
  * Added operation logging with consistent format
  * Added error tracking with context

Recent Changes:
- Enhanced logging and monitoring:
  * Added log_db_operation helper for consistent operation logging
  * Added get_db_state helper to track database state
  * Updated test fixtures with state logging
  * Added transaction boundary logging
  * Added connection state tracking

- Completed PostgresDB implementation:
  * Added missing CRUD methods for entities, properties, and relationships
  * Enhanced validation for all operations
  * Added proper error handling and logging
  * Added support for type/name entity lookup
  * Added relationship direction filtering
  * Fixed LIKE query handling to use parameterized patterns consistently
