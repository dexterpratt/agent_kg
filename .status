## Current State

Database Schema:
- Complete PostgreSQL schema defined in schema.sq
- Core knowledge graph tables implemented (entities, properties, relationships)
- Foreign key constraints and indexes properly defined

Implementation Status:
- PostgreSQL connection manager (PostgresDB) fully implemented with:
  * Robust error handling and connection retry logic
  * Entity CRUD operations with validation
  * Property operations with value type support
  * Relationship operations with bidirectional support
  * Comprehensive test coverage for all operations
- Test framework in place with fixtures and validation tests
- Ready to expose operations through FastMCP server

## Task History

2024-12-30:
- Attempted FastMCP implementation:
  * Removed tool_definitions.py and handlers.py in favor of direct FastMCP decorators
  * Simplified server implementation using FastMCP patterns
  * Updated to use uv package manager instead of conda
  * Configured server to run with fastmcp CLI
  * Updated Claude desktop config to use new execution pattern
  * Maintained existing PostgreSQL functionality
- Implementation notes:
  * Server uses FastMCP decorators for tool definitions
  * Simplified error handling and logging
  * Maintained existing database operations
  * Updated dependencies to use psycopg2-binary
  * Encountered module import issues with FastMCP execution
  * Tried absolute imports but still facing module resolution problems

## Current Challenges

1. Module Resolution
   - FastMCP execution cannot find 'src' module
   - Attempted solutions:
     * Added PYTHONPATH to environment variables (failed)
     * Changed to absolute imports (failed)
     * Installed package in development mode (completed)
   - Status:
     * Package installed with `pip install -e .`
     * Development mode installation should allow proper module resolution
     * Next step: Verify FastMCP can now properly import modules

2024-12-29:
- Simplified implementation to focus on core functionality:
  * Reduced tool definitions to basic entity operations (add/update/delete)
  * Removed complex relationship and context operations for initial phase
  * Fixed async/sync handler integration using run_in_executor
  * Simplified test suite to focus on MCP server functionality
  * Successfully resolved test discovery and execution issues
- Implementation notes:
  * Server properly wraps synchronous handlers in async using run_in_executor
  * Tests verify both successful operations and error handling
  * Basic entity operations working correctly through MCP interface

2024-12-21:
- Initial implementation with broader scope
- Set up project structure and documentation

## Current Goals

1. MCP Server Implementation
   - Expose core database operations through FastMCP tools
   - Implement proper error handling and validation
   - Ensure consistent response formats
   - Add tool documentation and examples

2. Testing
   - Add MCP server integration tests
   - Verify tool behavior through MCP inspector
   - Test error handling and edge cases

3. Documentation
   - Document exposed MCP tools and their usage
   - Provide example queries and operations
   - Update deployment documentation

## Planned Actions

1. Short-term (Next Task)
   - Implement FastMCP server with core tools
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Test through MCP inspector
   - Document tool usage and examples

2. Medium-term
   - Add advanced query capabilities
   - Implement batch operations
   - Add monitoring and logging
   - Consider caching strategies

## Policies

1. Development Guidelines
   - Keep implementation simple and focused
   - Add complexity only when clearly needed
   - Maintain clear documentation of changes

2. Testing Requirements
   - All core operations must have tests
   - Verify both success and error cases
   - Ensure database operations work correctly
   - Test MCP server integration thoroughly

3. Error Handling
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Handle common error cases gracefully
   - Maintain data consistency

4. Database Operations
   - Use clean_db fixture for tests
   - Handle transactions properly
   - Verify data persistence
