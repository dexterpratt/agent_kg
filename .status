## Task History

2024-12-21:
- Initialized task history tracking
- Current project status: Implementation complete, focusing on testing and optimization
- Main components in place: MCP server, PostgreSQL integration, knowledge graph operations
- Testing framework initialized with integration test policies established
- Next major focus: Expanding test coverage and implementing planned optimizations
- Initial test run revealed systematic issues:
  * Fixture problems: async_generator objects missing handlers/server attributes
  * Database connection issue: test_execute_query using production database
  * Action items:
    - Review async fixture implementations in conftest.py
    - Ensure proper database configuration in test environment
    - Fix test database isolation in postgres module tests
- Fixed server fixture implementation:
  * Added proper handlers initialization with test database

  * Added missing ToolHandlers import
  * Next steps:
    - Run tests to verify fixture fixes
    - Review test_postgres_module.py for database isolation
    - Add error handling for database connection issues
- Implementation notes:
  * Server fixture requires both handlers initialization and tool setup
  * Async fixtures need proper async context manager for cleanup
  * Test database configuration must be explicitly passed to avoid production db usage
- Test Framework Improvements:
  * Switched to pytest_asyncio.fixture for async fixtures
  * Removed redundant event_loop fixture to fix deprecation warnings
  * Fixed SQL query syntax in property validation test
  * Remaining issues to address:
    - Database connection pooling for concurrent tests

## Policies

1. Integration Testing
   - All new features require integration tests before merging
   - Integration tests must:
     * Test complete workflows across multiple components
     * Verify database state changes
     * Test MCP server interactions
     * Include error handling scenarios
   - Integration test environment must:
     * Use separate test database
     * Mock external dependencies
     * Reset to known state between test runs
   - Regular integration test runs in CI pipeline
   - Performance benchmarks included in integration suite

2. Testing Lessons & API Usage
   - MCP Server Interactions:
     * Always use async/await with server.call_tool
     * Tool responses are always List[TextContent]
     * Parse JSON responses carefully with proper error handling
     * Close server connections in cleanup
     * Use pytest_asyncio.fixture for async fixtures
     * Initialize MCP server before yielding in fixtures
   
   - Database Operations:
     * Use clean_db fixture to ensure isolated test state
     * Handle transaction rollbacks explicitly
     * Check foreign key constraints before deletions
     * Verify cascade operations work as expected
     * Use transactions for atomic cleanup operations
     * Handle "database in use" cleanup errors
   
   - Common Pitfalls:
     * Don't assume entity existence in relationship tests
     * Properties are always stored as strings, convert types accordingly
     * Handle JSON serialization/deserialization explicitly
     * Check for null/None in optional fields
     * Properly await async generators in fixtures
     * Use proper SQL query formatting with parameters
   
   - Token Rate Limit Mitigation:
     * Break large test files into smaller modules
     * Keep fixture setup concise and focused
     * Document test dependencies clearly
     * Record implementation progress in .status
     * Use clear error messages in commits
     * Save partial progress when hitting limits
   
   - Performance Considerations:
     * Use batched operations for bulk data
     * Implement proper connection pooling
     * Monitor query execution plans
     * Cache frequently accessed data

   - Token Management:
     * run tests individually or in small batches to large error outputs in prompts

   - Database Testing Configuration:
     * Use separate admin connection for database creation/deletion
     * Set ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT for database operations
     * Always use .env.test for test configuration
     * Common fixture scopes:
       - session: database creation, config loading
       - function: database connections, server instances
     * Cleanup considerations:
       - Drop test database after session
       - Close connections in finally blocks
       - Handle cleanup errors gracefully
     * Schema initialization:
       - Load schema.sq at database creation
       - Execute in correct order (dependencies)
       - Verify schema loaded successfully
     * Table cleanup order matters:
       - Delete in reverse dependency order
       - Handle foreign key constraints
       - Use explicit table list

   - Performance Testing Patterns:
     * Metrics tracking:
       - Use helper classes for consistent measurement
       - Track min, max, avg, median, p95
       - Log detailed performance statistics
       - Set explicit performance thresholds
     * Load testing scenarios:
       - Entity creation under load (100+ entities)
       - Query performance with large datasets (1000+ records)
       - Relationship operations at scale
       - Mixed concurrent operations
     * Batch operations:
       - Process in configurable batch sizes
       - Use asyncio.gather for concurrent execution
       - Monitor total execution time
       - Track per-operation timing
     * Performance assertions:
       - Set maximum acceptable latencies
       - Verify p95 percentile thresholds
       - Test concurrent operation limits
       - Measure resource scaling
     * Test data generation:
       - Create realistic data volumes
       - Vary property combinations
       - Build complex relationship networks
       - Test different query patterns

   - Integration Testing Patterns:
     * Test complete lifecycles:
       - Entity: create -> read -> update -> delete
       - Relationship: create -> query -> traverse
       - Context: set -> get specific -> get all
     * Data validation testing:
       - Property constraints and regex validation
       - Unique constraints
       - Foreign key relationships
     * Error handling coverage:
       - Non-existent resources
       - Duplicate creation attempts
       - Invalid relationships
       - Malformed data
     * Search operation testing:
       - Single vs multiple property conditions
       - Type + property combinations
       - Result count verification
     * State verification:
       - Verify changes persisted correctly
       - Check cascading effects
       - Validate property conversions
     * Test data patterns:
       - Use realistic, varied test data
       - Cover edge cases in property values
       - Test different entity/relationship types

   - MCP Server Testing Specifics:
     * Server.call_tool always returns List[TextContent], not raw data
     * Tool responses must be parsed from JSON string in TextContent.text
     * Tool schemas must be validated before execution:
       - Verify type == "object"
       - Check properties exist in inputSchema
     * Common errors to handle:
       - ValueError for non-existent tools
       - ValueError for invalid arguments
       - ValueError for invalid entity IDs
     * Concurrent operations considerations:
       - Use asyncio.gather for parallel tool calls
       - Ensure clean_db fixture runs between concurrent tests
       - Verify all concurrent operations completed
     * Tool response validation:
       - Always check response list length
       - Verify TextContent type before parsing
       - Use proper JSON parsing error handling

3. Error Recovery Patterns
   - Database Errors:
     * Retry transient failures with exponential backoff
     * Log detailed error context for debugging
     * Maintain data consistency in partial failures
   
   - API Usage:
     * Validate input before database operations
     * Use proper error types for different scenarios
     * Implement proper cleanup in error cases
     * Handle concurrent operation conflicts

4. Development Guidelines
   - Code Organization:
     * Keep handlers focused on single responsibility
     * Implement proper error propagation
     * Use type hints consistently
     * Document error conditions and handling
   
   - Testing Practices:
     * Test both success and failure paths
     * Include edge cases in test suite
     * Verify error messages are helpful
     * Test concurrent access patterns
