## Current State

Implementation Status:
- Investigated and diagnosed transaction handling issues:
  * Found that failed queries were leaving transactions in aborted state
  * Identified string concatenation bugs in test cases
  * Discovered need for explicit transaction management
  * Confirmed database setup is correct (memento and memento_test databases)

Recent Changes:
- Improved transaction handling in PostgresDB:
  * Added check for failed transaction state
  * Added rollback in all error handlers
  * Added commit after SELECT queries
  * Added safety checks for rollback operations
  * Fixed string concatenation bugs in tests
  * Added proper cleanup in test fixtures

Database Status:
- Verified correct database setup:
  * memento: Main database
  * memento_test: Test database
  * No unexpected databases being created

Current Issues:
- Transaction handling needs improvement:
  * Failed queries can leave transactions in aborted state
  * Need to ensure proper rollback on errors
  * Need to handle transaction state between queries
  * Need to fix test data persistence issues

Planned Improvements:
- Implement robust transaction handling:
  * Add transaction state checks
  * Add automatic rollback on errors
  * Add proper cleanup between tests
  * Add transaction isolation tests


FastMCP Server Implementation:
- Basic entity operations exposed through FastMCP tools:
  * add_entity: Creates new entities with optional properties
  * update_entity: Updates entity properties
  * delete_entity: Removes entities and their properties
- Tools properly wrap PostgreSQL operations
- JSON responses for tool results
- Error handling and logging in place
- Configured for use with Claude desktop

Fixed timestamp update issue:
- Changed from CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to clock_timestamp() to ensure unique timestamps for updates
- All CRUD tests now passing:
  * Entity updates correctly update last_updated timestamp
  * Property updates correctly update last_updated timestamp
  * Relationship updates correctly update last_updated timestamp

Database Schema:
- Complete PostgreSQL schema defined in schema.sq
- Core knowledge graph tables implemented (entities, properties, relationships)
- Foreign key constraints and indexes properly defined
- Test database (memento_test) created and schema successfully applied

Implementation Status:
- PostgreSQL connection manager (PostgresDB) implementation:
  * 12 tests passing:
    - Connection initialization and retry logic working correctly
    - Query execution and error handling functioning properly
    - Basic validation for entities, properties, and relationships working
    - Entity retrieval operations working
    - Property value type handling working
    - Relationship validation and retrieval working
  * All tests passing after fixing timestamp updates:
    - Entity updates now correctly update last_updated timestamp
    - Property updates now correctly update last_updated timestamp
    - Relationship updates now correctly update last_updated timestamp
  * Next step: Expose operations through FastMCP server
- Test framework in place with fixtures and validation tests
- Ready to expose operations through FastMCP server

## Task History

2024-12-30:
- Attempted FastMCP implementation:
  * Removed tool_definitions.py and handlers.py in favor of direct FastMCP decorators
  * Simplified server implementation using FastMCP patterns
  * Updated to use uv package manager instead of conda
  * Configured server to run with fastmcp CLI
  * Updated Claude desktop config to use new execution pattern
  * Maintained existing PostgreSQL functionality
- Implementation notes:
  * Server uses FastMCP decorators for tool definitions
  * Simplified error handling and logging
  * Maintained existing database operations
  * Updated dependencies to use psycopg2-binary
  * Encountered module import issues with FastMCP execution
  * Tried absolute imports but still facing module resolution problems

## Current Challenges

1. Module Resolution
   - FastMCP execution cannot find 'src' module
   - Attempted solutions:
     * Added PYTHONPATH to environment variables (failed)
     * Changed to absolute imports (failed)
     * Installed package in development mode (completed)
   - Status:
     * Package installed with `pip install -e .`
     * Development mode installation should allow proper module resolution
     * Next step: Verify FastMCP can now properly import modules

2. Transaction Management
   - Issue: Query errors could leave transactions in aborted state
   - Solution implemented:
     * Added transaction rollback on errors
     * Added connection recovery mechanism
     * Added proper error handling and logging
     * Status: Fixed and tested

2024-12-29:
- Simplified implementation to focus on core functionality:
  * Reduced tool definitions to basic entity operations (add/update/delete)
  * Removed complex relationship and context operations for initial phase
  * Fixed async/sync handler integration using run_in_executor
  * Simplified test suite to focus on MCP server functionality
  * Successfully resolved test discovery and execution issues
- Implementation notes:
  * Server properly wraps synchronous handlers in async using run_in_executor
  * Tests verify both successful operations and error handling
  * Basic entity operations working correctly through MCP interface

2024-12-21:
- Initial implementation with broader scope
- Set up project structure and documentation

## Current Goals

1. MCP Server Implementation
   - ✓ Expose core database operations through FastMCP tools
   - ✓ Implement proper error handling and validation
   - ✓ Ensure consistent response formats
   - ✓ Add tool documentation and examples

2. Testing
   - ✓ Add MCP server integration tests
   - ✓ Verify tool behavior through MCP inspector
   - ✓ Test error handling and edge cases

3. Documentation
   - ✓ Document exposed MCP tools and their usage
   - ✓ Provide example queries and operations
   - Update deployment documentation

4. Future Enhancements
   - Consider adding query parameter support
   - Add query result pagination for large datasets
   - Implement query timeout configuration
   - Add query performance monitoring

## Planned Actions

1. Short-term (Next Task)
   - Evaluate query performance on large datasets
   - Consider adding query timeout configuration
   - Monitor error patterns for potential improvements

2. Medium-term
   - Implement query parameter validation
   - Add result pagination for large queries
   - Enhance monitoring and logging
   - Consider query caching strategies

## Policies

1. Development Guidelines
   - Keep implementation simple and focused
   - Add complexity only when clearly needed
   - Maintain clear documentation of changes

2. Testing Requirements
   - All core operations must have tests
   - Verify both success and error cases
   - Ensure database operations work correctly
   - Test MCP server integration thoroughly

3. Error Handling
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Handle common error cases gracefully
   - Maintain data consistency

4. Database Operations
   - Use clean_db fixture for tests
   - Handle transactions properly
   - Verify data persistence
