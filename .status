## Current State

Database Schema:
- Complete PostgreSQL schema defined in schema.sq
- Core knowledge graph tables implemented (entities, properties)
- Foreign key constraints and indexes properly defined

Implementation Status:
- Converted to FastMCP implementation with simplified structure
- PostgreSQL connection manager implemented with retry logic
- Basic entity operations (add/update/delete) exposed as tools
- Environment configuration system in place
- Test framework simplified and focused on core functionality

## Task History

2024-12-30:
- Attempted FastMCP implementation:
  * Removed tool_definitions.py and handlers.py in favor of direct FastMCP decorators
  * Simplified server implementation using FastMCP patterns
  * Updated to use uv package manager instead of conda
  * Configured server to run with fastmcp CLI
  * Updated Claude desktop config to use new execution pattern
  * Maintained existing PostgreSQL functionality
- Implementation notes:
  * Server uses FastMCP decorators for tool definitions
  * Simplified error handling and logging
  * Maintained existing database operations
  * Updated dependencies to use psycopg2-binary
  * Encountered module import issues with FastMCP execution
  * Tried absolute imports but still facing module resolution problems

## Current Challenges

1. Module Resolution
   - FastMCP execution cannot find 'src' module
   - Attempted solutions:
     * Added PYTHONPATH to environment variables (failed)
     * Changed to absolute imports (failed)
     * Installed package in development mode (completed)
   - Status:
     * Package installed with `pip install -e .`
     * Development mode installation should allow proper module resolution
     * Next step: Verify FastMCP can now properly import modules

2024-12-29:
- Simplified implementation to focus on core functionality:
  * Reduced tool definitions to basic entity operations (add/update/delete)
  * Removed complex relationship and context operations for initial phase
  * Fixed async/sync handler integration using run_in_executor
  * Simplified test suite to focus on MCP server functionality
  * Successfully resolved test discovery and execution issues
- Implementation notes:
  * Server properly wraps synchronous handlers in async using run_in_executor
  * Tests verify both successful operations and error handling
  * Basic entity operations working correctly through MCP interface

2024-12-21:
- Initial implementation with broader scope
- Set up project structure and documentation

## Current Goals

1. Core Functionality
   - Focus on reliable entity operations
   - Ensure robust database interactions
   - Maintain simple, clear codebase
   - Verify FastMCP integration works correctly

2. Testing
   - Update tests for FastMCP implementation
   - Ensure database operations are properly tested
   - Verify MCP server integration works correctly

3. Documentation
   - Document simplified API and tools
   - Create basic usage examples
   - Document deployment process with uv

## Planned Actions

1. Short-term
   - Verify Claude desktop integration with FastMCP tools
   - Add basic error handling documentation
   - Test with realistic usage patterns

2. Medium-term
   - Consider adding relationship operations if needed
   - Evaluate need for additional features based on usage
   - Add monitoring for basic operations

## Policies

1. Development Guidelines
   - Keep implementation simple and focused
   - Add complexity only when clearly needed
   - Maintain clear documentation of changes

2. Testing Requirements
   - All core operations must have tests
   - Verify both success and error cases
   - Ensure database operations work correctly
   - Test MCP server integration thoroughly

3. Error Handling
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Handle common error cases gracefully
   - Maintain data consistency

4. Database Operations
   - Use clean_db fixture for tests
   - Handle transactions properly
   - Verify data persistence
